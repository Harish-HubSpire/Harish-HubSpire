👋 Hey there, I'm Harish S! 🚀

Hello, code wranglers! I'm a Full Stack Developer who thrives on brewing ☕ and building slick, scalable web apps. My toolbox is packed with PHP and JavaScript magic, and I sprinkle some frontend fairy dust with React, Vue, and more. Let’s dive into my coding playground! 🎉


🛠️ What I Wield
I’m like a tech Swiss Army knife, slicing through both backend and frontend challenges. Here’s the rundown:

Backend Wizardry 🧙‍♂️

PHP Frameworks: I’ve tamed the wild beasts of Drupal, Laravel, WordPress, Zend, Magento, OpenCart, and Yii2. From CMS to e-commerce, I’ve got it covered!
Node.js Environments: I spin up servers with ExpressJS and craft sleek APIs with Apollo GraphQL. Microservices? GraphQL schemas? Bring it on!

Frontend Flair 🎨

JavaScript Frameworks: I build snappy, interactive UIs with React and Vue. Dynamic, responsive, and oh-so-smooth.
Bonus: I’m no stranger to vanilla JS, CSS wizardry, and making pixels dance.

Full Stack Flow 🌊

I bridge the gap between server and client, ensuring apps are fast, secure, and user-friendly.
From database design to pixel-perfect frontends, I’m your one-stop dev shop.
